## Common Phylogenetic Terms

* Phylogenetic tree – Phylogenetic tree is a branching diagram or dendrogram illustrating the evolutionary relationships among species.

* UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean) – A simple clustering method that assumes a constant rate of evolution (molecular clock hypothesis). It needs a distance matrix of the analyzed taxa that can be calculated from a multiple alignment.

* Maximum parsimony (MP) – This method tries to create a phylogeny that requires the least evolutionary change.

* Maximum-likelihood (ML) – ML uses a statistical approach to infer a phylogenetic tree. ML is well suited for the analysis of distantly related sequences but is computationally expensive and thus not that well suited for larger input data.

* Bootstrapping – Bootstrapping is a statistical resampling technique that is often used to increase the confidence that the inferred tree is correct.

* Outgroups – When using distance matrix methods, it is highly recommended to include at least one distantly related sequence for the analysis. This is a negative control. The outgroup should appear near the root of the tree and should have a longer branch length than any other sequence.
