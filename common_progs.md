## Common bioinformatics software:

* [Abricate](https://github.com/tseemann/abricate) – program that screens the assembled contigs for virulence genes and acquired resistance genes

* [Lyve – SET](https://github.com/lskatz/lyve-SET) – (SET: Snp Extraction Tool) core genome pipeline using RaXML to examine relatedness of strains for outbreak investigation, hqSNP (high quality SNP analysis)

* [Kraken](https://github.com/DerrickWood/kraken2) – taxonomic sequence classifier

* [Spades](https://github.com/ablab/spades) – utilized for the de novo assembly of raw reads into contigs

* [Quast](http://quast.sourceforge.net/quast) – evaluates the quality of the assembled genome

* [Mash](https://github.com/marbl/Mash) – distance estimate for genome and metagenomes

* [Serotype finder](https://bitbucket.org/genomicepidemiology/serotypefinder.git) - serotyping of Escherichia coli

* [Seq Sero](https://github.com/denglab/SeqSero) – Salmonella serotype identification

* [SISTR](https://github.com/phac-nml/sistr_cmd) – Salmonella in silico typing resource, alternative to SeqSero

* [PROKKA](https://github.com/tseemann/prokka) – rapid prokaryotic genome annotation

* [Trimmomatic](http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic) – read and adapter trimming of the raw reads

* [IqTree](http://www.iqtree.org) – program used for phylogenetic inference using maximum likelihood with fast bootstrapping and ability to change the model used for analysis

* [Unicycler](https://github.com/rrwick/Unicycler) – assembly pipeline that can assemble short read and long read only sets as well as hybrid sets that combine short and long reads

* [Roary](https://sanger-pathogens.github.io/Roary/) – identifies the pan genome using annotated assemblies from Prokka, utilized for reference free phylogenetic analysis

* [Shovill](https://github.com/tseemann/shovill) – faster Spades assembler, can also run other assemblers (ie Velvet)

* [BLAST](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) – Basic Local Alignment Search Tool, used to identify regions of similarity between amino acid or nucleotide sequences against a database or a known sequence that are above a specific threshold

* Source Control / Version Control – tracking of changes made to files or authorship to be able to recall previous versions. Github is a way to keep track of changes made to files and identify who made the changes.

* [StaPH-B](https://github.com/StaPH-B) – State public health bioinformaticians workgroup
