# Demystifying Bioinformatics

## What is bioinformatics?

### Bioinformatics defined:

"Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field that develops computational methods and tools for analyzing biological data"

### Disciplines that make up bioinformatics:

 1. Biology, which is the "study of living organisms, divided into many specialized fields that cover their morphology, physiology, anatomy, behavior, origin, and distribution."
 2. Computer Science, which is the "study of the principles and use of computers."
 3. Mathematics, which is the "abstract science of number, quantity, and space."

Figures to be included: 
 - Venn diagram of biology, computer science, and mathematics

### What do bioinformaticians do?

Bioinformaticians analyze biological data using computers. The more accurate (but complex) answer is that there are three main things a bioinformatician does:

 1. Analyze data
 2. Develop methods/software
 3. Model biological systems/processes
 
## Sequencing

The first generation of sequencing technology. Uses chain termination during DNA replication to determine the DNA sequence. 

Figures to be included: 
 - Chain termination gel
 - Chromatogram

#### Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)

AKA "high-throughput" or "massively parallel" sequencing.

#### Short-read Sequencing
The second generation of sequencing technology.

Examples include:

 - Illumina
	 - Paired- vs single-end sequencing
 - Pyrosequencing (454; now defunct)

Figures to be included: 
 - Illumina sequencing process (includes bridge amplification)
 - Illumina flow cell color fluorescence
 - Pyrosequencing process
 
#### Long-read Sequencing

The third generation of sequencing technologies

Examples include:

 - PacBio (HiFi)
 - Oxford Nanopore

Figures to be included: 
 - HiFi/SMRT sequencing process
 - Nanopore sequencing process
 
#### Short- vs Long-Read Sequencing
 
Advantages and disadvantages of each technology

Short-read sequencing:
 - Advantages: Low cost, highly accurate
 - Disadvantages: Difficult to assemble short-read data from highly repetitive genomes, as well as plasmids
 
Long-read sequencing:
 - Advantages: Long reads can be used to assemble and resolve entire genomes and plasmids
 - Disadvantages: More expensive than short-read sequencing and less accurate (although significant improvements in accuracy have been made)

 
#### Sanger Sequencing vs NGS

### Types of Sequencing

#### Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS)

#### Targeted Sequencing

#### Whole Exome Sequencing (WES)

#### Amplicon Sequencing

#### Hybridization Capture

## The Omics

Genomics
Transcriptomics
Proteomics 
Metabolomics
The meta-omics

## Genome Assembly

### Reference Guided

### *De Novo*

## Genomic Relatedness

## Methods for Determining Relatedness

Methods for determining genomic relatedness fall into two major categories: 
1. Standardized
2. Non-standardized

### Standardized methods

#### Multilocus sequence typing (MLST)

#### Core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST)

#### Whole-genome multilocus sequence typing (wgMLST)

#### Advantages of standardized methods

#### Disadvantages of standardized methods

#### Examples of standardized methods

PubMLST
Bionumerics

### Non-Standardized Methods

#### SNP analysis

#### Core genome analysis

#### Advantages of non-standardized methods

#### Disadvantages of non-standardized methods

#### Examples of non-standardized methods
