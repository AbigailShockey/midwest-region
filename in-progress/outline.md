# Demystifying Bioinformatics

## What is bioinformatics?

### Bioinformatics defined:
"Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field that develops computational methods and tools for analyzing biological data"

### Disciplines that make up bioinformatics:

 1. Biology, which is the "study of living organisms, divided into many specialized fields that cover their morphology, physiology, anatomy, behavior, origin, and distribution."
 2. Computer Science, which is the "study of the principles and use of computers."
 3. Mathematics, which is the "abstract science of number, quantity, and space."

### What do bioinformaticians do?

Bioinformaticians analyze biological data using computers. The more accurate (but complex) answer is there are three main things a bioinformatician does:

 1. Analyze data
 2. Develop methods/software
 3. Model biological systems/processes
 
## Sequencing

### Sanger Sequencing

### Next-Generation Sequencing

### Short vs long read sequencing
