# Demystifying Bioinformatics

## What is bioinformatics?

### Bioinformatics defined:
"Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field that develops computational methods and tools for analyzing biological data"

### Disciplines that make up bioinformatics:

 1. Biology, which is the "study of living organisms, divided into many specialized fields that cover their morphology, physiology, anatomy, behavior, origin, and distribution."
 2. Computer Science, which is the "study of the principles and use of computers."
 3. Mathematics, which is the "abstract science of number, quantity, and space."

 - Venn diagram of biology, computer science, and mathematics

### What do bioinformaticians do?

Bioinformaticians analyze biological data using computers. The more accurate (but complex) answer is that there are three main things a bioinformatician does:

 1. Analyze data
 2. Develop methods/software
 3. Model biological systems/processes

### Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)

#### Short-read Sequencing
The second generation of sequencing tech

Examples include:

 - Illumina
 - Pyrosequencing (now rarely used)

Figures to be included:

#### Long-read Sequencing

The third generation of sequencing technologies

Examples include:

PacBio
