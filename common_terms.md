# Common Bioinformatics Terms
### Here is a list of common terms or programs that you might hear:

* Abricate – program that screens the assembled contigs for virulence genes and acquired resistance genes (https://github.com/tseemann/abricate)

* Lyve – SET – (SET: Snp Extraction Tool) core genome pipeline using RaXML to examine relatedness of strains for outbreak investigation, hqSNP (high quality SNP analysis) (https://github.com/lskatz/lyve-SET)

* Kraken – taxonomic sequence classifier (https://github.com/DerrickWood/kraken2)

* Spades – utilized for the de novo assembly of raw reads into contigs (https://github.com/ablab/spades)

* Quast – evaluates the quality of the assembled genome (http://quast.sourceforge.net/quast)

* Mash – distance estimate for genome and metagenomes (https://github.com/marbl/Mash)

* Serotype finder- serotyping of Escherichia coli (https://bitbucket.org/genomicepidemiology/serotypefinder.git)

* Seq Sero – Salmonella serotype identification (https://github.com/denglab/SeqSero)

* SISTR – Salmonella in silico typing resource, alternative to SeqSero (https://github.com/phac-nml/sistr_cmd)

* PROKKA – rapid prokaryotic genome annotation (https://github.com/tseemann/prokka)

* Trimmomatic – read and adapter trimming of the raw reads (http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic)

* IqTree – program used for phylogenetic inference using maximum likelihood with fast bootstrapping and ability to change the model used for analysis (http://www.iqtree.org)

* Unicycler – assembly pipeline that can assemble short read and long read only sets as well as hybrid sets that combine short and long reads (https://github.com/rrwick/Unicycler)

* Roary – identifies the pan genome using annotated assemblies from Prokka, utilized for reference free phylogenetic analysis (https://sanger-pathogens.github.io/Roary/)

* CDC – Spn – scripts and files for Streptococcus pneumoniae pipeline (https://github.com/BenJamesMetcalf/Spn_Scripts_Reference)

* Shovill – faster Spades assembler, can also run other assemblers (ie Velvet) (https://github.com/tseemann/shovill)

* Bit score – scaled raw score that allows comparison across searches regardless of the query length

* BLAST – Basic Local Alignment Search Tool, used to identify regions of similarity between amino acid or nucleotide sequences against a database or a known sequence that are above a specific threshold. (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi)

* Source Control / Version Control – tracking of changes made to files or authorship to be able to recall previous versions. Github is a way to keep track of changes made to files and identify who made the changes.
* StaPH-B – State public health bioinformaticians workgroup (https://github.com/StaPH-B)
